**I apologize in advance if this write-up is not comprehensible or coherent. I am willing to answer any questions for clarification.**

Hello! My name is David D. Lee, and I'm currently a sophomore at Wheaton College! I've gotten very interested in web development last summer, and I made my own website from scratch called Dirty Code http://dirtycode.net/ (it's a bad CS joke with Big O notation). It's not a well designed site, I'm still learning! :)

Now, why you're here:

The purpose of Bruce is for students at Wheaton College, IL to easily plan their classes before registration for the semester opens. The site will include a calendar of the week (similar to the "Week at a Glance" from Banner Self Service, but better). Included will be a search bar to the left hand side on the upper corner to easily look up classes. On the left will be a list of "majors/categories of study" so that students can click on and look at the classes under each sect. 

Once a student has selected a class, a block will appear on the calendar. Each "block" on the calendar will have the class number, the prof name, time, CRN, and the location. If there are conflicting time blocks, the 2 blocks will appear as red. 


This idea was inspired by Northwestern University's https://www.salad.nu/ In fact, it's the exact same idea, but for Wheaton College. 

The hope for this website is that it'll serve as a wonderful resource for other Wheaties and to spare a few headaches when registration rolls around. 

More elements & features TBD, this is the best I have for now. If you have any questions, please email me at david.lee@my.wheaton.edu. Thank you so much!

P.S. The reason that the website name is Bruce is that Wheaton uses Banner Self Service, so... Bruce Banner! Haha? Anyone? Ok...
